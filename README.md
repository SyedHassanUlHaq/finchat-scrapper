# FinChat Scraper

This project is designed to scrape US equity data such as financial filings, SEC documents, press releases, and more from FinChat. The extracted data is stored in JSON format and pushed to a MongoDB database, enabling seamless data analysis and integration into other systems.

- **Generic Scraper**: Tested successfully with over 250 equities, proving its ability to work for all equities available on FinChat. The scraper is designed to adapt to changes in the website structure with minimal modifications.
- **Data Storage**: Extracted data is stored in JSON format and seamlessly integrated into MongoDB, making it easy to query and analyze the data for further insights.
- **Scalability**: The scraper is built to handle large volumes of data efficiently, making it suitable for both small-scale and enterprise-level use cases.
- **Error Handling**: Includes mechanisms to handle errors gracefully, ensuring uninterrupted operation even when encountering unexpected issues.
